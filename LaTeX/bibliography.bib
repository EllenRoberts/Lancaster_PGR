In discussing sources for digitised historical play-texts and criteria for making a selection for the present study, I argue that not just any set of Early Modern English plays constitutes a suitable basis upon which to make reliable claims about language style in Shakespeare’s plays relative to those of his peers. I point out factors outside of authorial choice which potentially have bearing on language style, such as sub-genre features and change over time. I also highlight some particular difficulties in compiling a corpus of historical texts, notably dating and spelling variation, and I explain how these were addressed. The corpus detailed in this article extends the prospects for investigating Shakespeare’s language style by providing a context into which it can be set and, as I indicate, is a valuable new publicly accessible resource for future research.},

It oﬀers many packages written by contributors from all over the world and programming resources that allow it to overcome the dialog limitations of {SPSS}. This paper oﬀers an {SPSS} dialog written in the R programming language with the help of some packages, so that researchers with little or no knowledge in programming, or those who are accustomed to making their calculations based on statistical dialogs, have more options when applying factor analysis to their data and hence can adopt a better approach when dealing with ordinal, Likert-type data.},

Using the case of an exploratory factor analysis procedure—principal axis factoring ({PAF}) and promax rotation—we show that this assumption is not always justified. Procedures with equal names are sometimes implemented differently across programs: a jingle fallacy. Focusing on two popular statistical analysis programs, we indeed discovered a jingle jungle for the above procedure: Both {PAF} and promax rotation are implemented differently in the psych R package and in {SPSS}. Based on analyses with 247 real and 216,000 simulated data sets implementing 108 different data structures, we show that these differences in implementations can result in fairly different factor solutions for a variety of different data structures. Differences in the solutions for real data sets ranged from negligible to very large, with 42\% displaying at least one different indicator-to-factor correspondence. A simulation study revealed systematic differences in accuracies between different implementations, and large variation between data structures, with small numbers of indicators per factor, high factor intercorrelations, and weak factors resulting in the lowest accuracies. Moreover, although there was no single combination of settings that was superior for all data structures, we identified implementations of {PAF} and promax that maximize performance on average. We recommend researchers to use these implementations as best way through the jungle, discuss model averaging as a potential alternative, and highlight the importance of adhering to best practices of scale construction.},

A new algorithm named ‘zig-zag {EFA}’ is introduced for the simultaneous least squares estimation of all {EFA} model unknowns. As in principal component analysis, zig-zag {EFA} is based on the singular value decomposition of data matrices. Another advantage of the proposed computational routine is that it facilitates the estimation of both common and unique factor scores. Applications to both real and artiﬁcial data illustrate the algorithm and the {EFA} solutions.},

	abstract = {For centuries, investigations of disputed authorship have shown that people have unique styles of writing. Given sufficient data, it is generally possible to distinguish between the writings of a small group of authors, for example, through the multivariate analysis of the relative frequencies of common function words. There is, however, no accepted explanation for why this type of stylometric analysis is successful. Authorship analysts often argue that authors write in subtly different dialects, but the analysis of individual words is not licensed by standard theories of sociolinguistic variation. Alternatively, stylometric analysis is consistent with standard theories of register variation. In this paper, I argue that stylometric methods work because authors write in subtly different registers. To support this claim, I present the results of parallel stylometric and multidimensional register analyses of a corpus of newspaper articles written by two columnists. I demonstrate that both analyses not only distinguish between these authors but identify the same underlying patterns of linguistic variation. I therefore propose that register variation, as opposed to dialect variation, provides a basis for explaining these differences and for explaining stylometric analyses of authorship more generally.},

              Variation has been demonstrated in modal use between written and spoken registers and between disciplines. This article investigates variation within a discipline by comparing modals of obligation and necessity used in three science genres. Obligation modals project strong authoritative stance, thus contrasting with the tendency in academic writing towards tentativeness. The modal auxiliaries
              must
              and
              should
              and quasi-modals
              have to
              and
              need to
              are investigated using student writing from the {BAWE} (British Academic Written English) corpus and a corpus of published research articles. Findings include a dearth of obligation modals in the empirical genres (research articles and laboratory reports). Also a greater prominence was found of dynamic modal meaning (where necessity arises from circumstances) rather than deontic meaning (where the necessity arises from human authority or rules). A further finding is the prominence of objective meaning in the science register compared with the International Corpus of English (
              Collins 2009a
              ).},

	abstract = {Research synthesis and meta‐analysis provide a pathway to bring together findings in a given domain with greater systematicity, objectivity, and transparency than traditional reviews. The same techniques and corresponding benefits can be and have been applied to examine methodological practices in second language (L2) research (e.g., Plonsky,
              
              ). In the first half of this paper, we integrate findings, trends, and critiques from a number of syntheses to both illustrate the potential of this approach and to promote more methodologically informed research practices. Our emphasis here is on study designs and sampling practices. In the second half, we provide an example of a methodological synthesis that reviews the use of one particular statistical technique as applied in L2 research: exploratory factor analysis ({EFA}). Here and throughout the chapter, we provide specific recommendations for primary research as well as for future efforts to synthesize methodological practices in the field.},
