# Introduction to LaTeX for the Social Sciences

**Location: Science and Technology Computer Lab A008**
**Time/Date: Wednesday 9th November 2-3.30pm**
 
LaTeX is a document formatting system and offers an alternative to the likes of word processors such as MS Word and Google Docs for writing theses and other research papers. At its core, LaTeX aims to deal with the appearance of documents, so we (as researchers) can focus on the content! (No more wrestling of images or graphs into a word processor required!). Examples of LaTeX documents can be found here: https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates. LaTeX is already a popular choice for those within the sciences and is gaining traction within the social sciences too.
 
This workshop will offer an introduction to using LaTeX via Overleaf (an online editor) for those in the social sciences. The workshop will offer a hands-on opportunity to explore how LaTeX can not only produce beautiful looking documents easily, but also how it may make the writing process easier in the long-term.
 
We have booked a computer lab for this session but you are welcome to use your own laptop if you prefer. You will need access to a web browser for this session.

The first introductory 20 minutes of the workshop will be recorded or available to watch live via Teams, but we recommend attendance in person to practise and fully benefit from the training
