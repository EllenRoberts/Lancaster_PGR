# Using LaTeX and Overleaf for Writing in the Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences

**Location: Science and Technology Computer Lab A008**
**Time/Date: Tuesday 20th May, 10am-noon**
 
LaTeX is a document formatting system and offers an alternative to the likes of word processors such as MS Word, Libre Office, and Google Docs. It can be used for different written documents, such as journal articles, theses, books and other research papers; many publishers provide a LaTeX template for these.
 
At its core, LaTeX aims to deal with the appearance of documents, so we (as researchers) can focus on the content! In other words, no more wrestling of images or graphs into a word processor! Examples of LaTeX documents can be found here. LaTeX is already a popular choice for those in the sciences and is gaining traction in the social sciences too.

This workshop offers an introduction to using LaTeX via Overleaf (an online editor) for those in linguistics and other social sciences. The workshop offers a hands-on opportunity to explore how LaTeX can not only produce beautiful looking documents easily, but also how it may make the writing process easier in the long-term.
