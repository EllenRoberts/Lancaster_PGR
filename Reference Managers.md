### The Recording:

Here is a link to the recording (slides and voiceover) for the session. It is accessible to watch online via my OneDrive to those at Lancaster University _only_. Please note, the recording will not be available indefinitely, but will be available for at least 3 months (from November 2022). Also, please note that the fire alarm did go off halfway through - it only lasts a few seconds, but warning for the noise.

- Very detailed resource on getting started with Zotero from the Discord Academic Research Community. Very long but like a Zotero guide for beginners, would recommend highly! Link to PDF is [here!](https://darcmode.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/DARC-Zotero-Guide-Web.pdf)

### FAQs:

**Q: How much of the session was recorded?**

A: Only the first 20 mins or so. In other words, the introductory slides were recorded but the hands-on part of the session was not recorded.

**Q: Will there be another workshop?**

A: At the moment, only the November session has been scheduled. If you would like to see another one/something similar send me an email (e.roberts9ATlancaster...) and I will raise this to the department if enough interest is raised.
 
**Q: I couldn’t make the session, but want to find out more. Where can I find out more?**

A: On this page, you will find some useful links above that may be able to get you started with Zotero/reference management.
 
**Q: I can’t get Zotero downloaded on my device – what should I do?**

A: Please have a look online and see if someone in the large Zotero community has faced the same issue and come up with a solution. If you are really stuck, send me an email and I will see if I can help troubleshoot the issue.
